# get-started

Welcome to the IBM Watson Data Platform Beta Program. If you've reached this page and you're not a beta participant, please contact us at: **need a contact email here**.

As described in your welcome email, to get started with the beta:

1. Sign in to IBM Data Science Experience using your IBM ID (Bluemix Account) and select WDP Beta as your Organization during sign in.
1. We've created a sample beta scenario and a set of notebooks that you can use as functional tutorials to try out all of the features of the beta. The notebooks and sample data are stored in this GitHub repository.
1. Download these notebooks and data sets and then, as you work your way through the scenario and notebooks, you'll be instructed to upload them into a Data Science Experience project so that you can begin working with them.
